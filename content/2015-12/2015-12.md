# The Scribus Community Newsletter, December 2015

## Talking about color management

Color management has been for a long time one of the strengths of Scribus. But it has also been one of the biggest stumbling blocks for many amateur layouters.

Most of them first know about color management when a print shop requests a Pdf in a version that requires color profiles to be used. The other way into color management relates to a printed work that gets back with less vibrant color than you had on your monitor.

## About this newsletter

This is a Scribus newsletter published by contributors from the Scribus community.
Our goal is to produce one issue per month presenting different aspects of the life in the Scribus community.

TODO: complete the contributors list  
The  December issue has been written by Ale and Kunda.  

You can contribute through our Github repository <https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter> or by getting in touch with us in any way you see fit ([forum](http://forums.scribus.net), [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=scribus), [mailing list](http://lists.scribus.net), [twitter](https://twitter.com/scribus), email, ...)

Currently we are looking for more redactors, translators, and a graphic designer who proposes a nice HTML style for this newsletter.  
We would also like to see designers create a PDF version of each issue.

You can also ask us to cover specific topics, by commenting on the [ticket for the next issue](https://github.com/aoloe/scribus-newsletter/issues/21)).
